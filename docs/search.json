I specialise in teaching research methods, statistics, and data skills using R/RStudio to psychology students. For my administration roles, I am the deputy lead for third-year on our BSc Psychology programme.\nFor my scholarship, I spend most of my time developing open educational resources on research methods and statistics for students and researchers. On my open educational resources page, you will find materials such as data skills workbooks, a guide on power analysis, and creating books and websites for researchers. My research focuses on pedagogy for teaching and assessment in Higher Education, in addition to replication studies, open science, and other projects that catch my eye.\nJames Bartlett (2025) CC BY 4.0."

We are steadily building the book as a resource and my contributions have currently been:\n\nIntroduction - Here we outline the motiviation behind our book and what knowledge we expect to engage with the book.\nCreating synthetic datasets - I led on our first substantive chapter to demonstrate creating synthetic data sets when ethics concerns might limit sharing data from participants. Previous tutorials were highly technical or focused on topics researchers in the scholarship of teaching and learning might not resonate with, so we wanted to write an accessible introduction."

    "text": "OSF preregistration R Markdown template\nWhen I preregister a study, my favourite template to use was the OSF preregistration challenge. Now that the challenge has finished, the COS have created an updated template. When you select a template on the OSF, there is the option to include an R script to demonstrate something like a power analysis or planned analysis. I thought it would be a good idea to streamline this process and combine the preregistration template with the power of R.\nI created a .Rmd file with the OSF preregistration template headers and information. Now you can write your preregistration using R Markdown and provide any code and output directly, making it fully reproducible. You can download the template here on my Github page.\nFor an example of how it can be used, you can find the preregistration for one of my studies on the OSF. The final knitted version of the document is available as a PDF for easy reading, and the .Rmd file is available for reproducibility. You can also find a YouTube video of a workshop I presented demonstrating how you can use the template for preregistration."

There are currently three tasks included: the Stroop task, Eriksen Flanker task, and a Go NoGo task with images. The guide and images for the third task are available on my OSF project page for cognitive tasks.\nI built several experiments using OpenSesame and PsychoPy for my PhD and for undergraduates to use in their dissertations. You may find it useful to adapt one of the cognitive tasks I have built for your own research. You can download them from the OSF.\nLast updated: 27/02/2019.\nThe current list of available tasks is:\n\nGo-NoGo Task (OpenSesame)\nEriksen Flanker Task (OpenSesame)\nDot Probe Task (OpenSesame and PsychoPy)\nAnti-Saccade Task (PsychoPy)"

I am always up for running workshops, so please reach out if you are interested! We can discuss costs depending on the budget you have available.\n\n\nI have run workshops from 1-3 hours for creating open educational materials and reproducible presentations using Quarto and Github using my Dissemination using Quarto and Github Pages guide.\nPast workshops:\n\nUK Conference on Teaching Statistics, Glasgow, 25/06/2025.\nSoftware Upskilling for Researchers, University of Glasgow, 28/03/2025.\nSchool of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Glasgow, 28/06/2024.\n\n\n\n\nI have delivered workshops on using papaja (Aust & Barth, 2022) to create reproducible APA-style manuscripts. When you download the template, it is easy to see how you complete the YAML, but as a template, the bulk of the manuscript is blank. Therefore, I created a mock example using just a few packages to show how you can use it for your own study. You can access the workshop slides and mock example files here on my Github repo.\nPast workshops:\n\nSoftware Upskilling for Researchers, University of Glasgow, 28/03/2025.\nMethods and Metascience discussion group, University of Glasgow, 16/09/2024.\n\n\n\n\nTogether with Wil Toivo, we ran an introduction to data visualisation using R/RStudio for PhD students at the SGSSS summer school. We adapted a guide from colleagues in our department to develop an online book for the workshop. We introduce students to R/RStudio, data visualisation principles, and used pair programming as an effective way of structuring the session.\nPast workshops:\n\nSGSSS Summer School, Dundee, 05/06/2024.\nSGSSS Summer School, Edinburgh, 08/06/2023.\nSGSSS Summer School, Edinburgh, 16/06/2022."
