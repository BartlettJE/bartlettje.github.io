Iâ€™m Dr James Bartlett, a lecturer in psychology on the learning, teaching, and scholarship track at the University of Glasgow, UK. I specialise in teaching research methods, statistics, and data skills using R/RStudio to psychology students. For my administration roles, I am the deputy lead for third-year on our BSc Psychology programme.

For my scholarship, I spend most of my time developing open educational resources on research methods and statistics for students and researchers. On my open educational resources page, you will find materials such as data skills workbooks, a guide on power analysis, and creating books and websites for researchers. My research focuses on pedagogy for teaching and assessment in Higher Education, in addition to replication studies, open science, and other projects that catch my eye.

## CV

You can download a detailed CV on [this page](files/cv-james-bartlett.pdf){target="_blank"}. In a previous role, I also delivered a journey lecture which acts as a kind of CV of failure. The slides outline elements of privilege and luck which were important for where I am today. You can access the [PDF slides on this page](files/journey_lecture.pdf){target="_blank"} if you are interested.
