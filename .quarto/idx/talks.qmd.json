I am always up for running workshops, so please reach out if you are interested! We can discuss costs depending on the budget you have available. \n\n### Dissemination using Quarto and Github Pages\n\nI have run workshops from 1-3 hours for creating open educational materials and reproducible presentations using Quarto and Github using my [Dissemination using Quarto and Github Pages](https://bartlettje.github.io/dissemination_quarto/){target=\"_blank\"} guide. \n\nPast workshops: \n\n- UK Conference on Teaching Statistics, Glasgow, 25/06/2025. \n\n- Software Upskilling for Researchers, University of Glasgow, 28/03/2025. \n\n- School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Glasgow, 28/06/2024. \n\n### APA-style manuscripts with RMarkdown and papaja demonstration \n\nI have delivered workshops on using papaja ([Aust & Barth, 2022](https://github.com/crsh/papaja){target=\"_blank\"}) to create reproducible APA-style manuscripts. When you download the template, it is easy to see how you complete the YAML, but as a template, the bulk of the manuscript is blank. Therefore, I created a mock example using just a few packages to show how you can use it for your own study. You can access the workshop slides and mock example files [here on my Github repo](https://github.com/BartlettJE/papaja_demo){target=\"_blank\"}. \n\nPast workshops: \n\n- Software Upskilling for Researchers, University of Glasgow, 28/03/2025. \n\n- Methods and Metascience discussion group, University of Glasgow, 16/09/2024.\n\n### Introduction to data visualisation using R/RStudio\n\nTogether with Wil Toivo, we ran an introduction to data visualisation using R/RStudio for PhD students at the SGSSS summer school. We adapted a guide from colleagues in our department to develop an [online book](https://wtoivo.github.io/SGSSS-data-viz-workshop/){target=\"_blank\"} for the workshop. We introduce students to R/RStudio, data visualisation principles, and used pair programming as an effective way of structuring the session. \n\nPast workshops: \n\n- SGSSS Summer School, Dundee, 05/06/2024. \n\n- SGSSS Summer School, Edinburgh, 08/06/2023. \n\n- SGSSS Summer School, Edinburgh, 16/06/2022. \n\n## Talks\n\nThe following section is an overview of conference talks I have delivered, with links to the materials where possible. \n\n### 2025\n\n- **Bartlett, J.
