## Workshops

I run workshops based on my open educational materials, from an introduction to R/RStudio for wrangling, visualisation, and analysis, to demonstrating how to create open education materials. I am always up for running workshops, so please reach out if you are interested! We can discuss costs depending on the budget you have available. 

### Dissemination using Quarto and Github Pages

I have run workshops from 1-3 hours for creating open educational materials and reproducible presentations using Quarto and Github using my [Dissemination using Quarto and Github Pages](https://bartlettje.github.io/dissemination_quarto/){target="_blank"} guide. 

Past workshops: 

- UK Conference on Teaching Statistics, Glasgow, 25/06/2025. 

- Software Upskilling for Researchers, University of Glasgow, 28/03/2025. 

- School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Glasgow, 28/06/2024. 

### APA-style manuscripts with RMarkdown and papaja demonstration 

I have delivered workshops on using papaja ([Aust & Barth, 2022](https://github.com/crsh/papaja){target="_blank"}) to create reproducible APA-style manuscripts. When you download the template, it is easy to see how you complete the YAML, but as a template, the bulk of the manuscript is blank. Therefore, I created a mock example using just a few packages to show how you can use it for your own study. You can access the workshop slides and mock example files [here on my Github repo](https://github.com/BartlettJE/papaja_demo){target="_blank"}. 

Past workshops: 

- Software Upskilling for Researchers, University of Glasgow, 28/03/2025. 

- Methods and Metascience discussion group, University of Glasgow, 16/09/2024.

### Introduction to data visualisation using R/RStudio

Together with Wil Toivo, we ran an introduction to data visualisation using R/RStudio for PhD students at the SGSSS summer school. We adapted a guide from colleagues in our department to develop an [online book](https://wtoivo.github.io/SGSSS-data-viz-workshop/){target="_blank"} for the workshop. We introduce students to R/RStudio, data visualisation principles, and used pair programming as an effective way of structuring the session. 

Past workshops: 

- SGSSS Summer School, Dundee, 05/06/2024. 

- SGSSS Summer School, Edinburgh, 08/06/2023. 

- SGSSS Summer School, Edinburgh, 16/06/2022.
